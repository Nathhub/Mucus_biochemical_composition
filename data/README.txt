METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Briefly: Total lipids were extracted using a single-step extraction method based on the chloroform–methanol solvent system following the protocol by Axelsson and Gentili (2014; see details in Supplementary Information (SI)). Total proteins were measured using a modification of the Lowry assay by Gerhardt et al. (1994; see details in SI). Total carbohydrates were measured following the protocol by DuBois et al. (1956, see details in SI). The carbon and nitrogen content of the samples were measured using a CHNS Elemental Analyzer (Elementar Vario Micro Cube, see details in SI). Ash-free dry weight (AFDW, i.e. the organic portion of the dry weight) was calculated by measuring the ash weight (AW) following combustion at 400°C in a muffle furnace using an ultra-microbalance (Sartorius SE2, readability: 0.1 μg; see details in SI) and subtracting this value from the dry weight (DW; AFDW = DW – AW). All samples were measured in triplicate.
